HW1 README

Part 1 of the homework creates hybrid images using phase and magnitude. 
The MATLIB files required are part1i.m, part1ii.m, and part1iii.m. 
The program requires the data folder containing images from the class.

To run the each program, open the .m file and run in MATLIB. Each program will output and display the final images to a figure.
